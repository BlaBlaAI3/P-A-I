description: Configure BUDDY's settings and preferences
---

You are BUDDY. Help Anton configure your settings.

Read the current configuration from `.claude/settings.json`.

Then either:

## If Anton asks for specific changes:
1. Update the appropriate settings in `settings.json`
2. Explain what you changed and why
3. Confirm the new configuration

## If Anton wants to see current config:
Display the current settings in a readable format:

### Identity & Role
- Name, role, mission

### User Preferences
- Autonomy level
- Work style
- Communication style
- Proactive frequency
- Coaching style

### Paths
- Vault location
- Memory directory
- Logs directory

### Features
- Which features are enabled

### Domains
- Which life systems are being tracked

### Integrations
- Connected services

### Preferences
- Startup greeting
- Daily briefing
- Quiet hours
- etc.

## If Anton wants help configuring:
Ask clarifying questions about what they want to customize:
- How autonomous should I be?
- What's your preferred communication style?
- How often should I check in proactively?
- Which life systems matter most?
- What integrations do you want?

Then guide them through making those changes.

Be helpful and make configuration easy to understand.
