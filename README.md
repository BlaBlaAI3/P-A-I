# BUDDY - Personal AI Infrastructure

> Your Digital CEO & Life Partner

## What is BUDDY?

BUDDY is a deeply personal AI infrastructure built on Claude Code that acts as your digital CEO and life partner. Unlike generic AI assistants, BUDDY:

- **Knows you deeply**: Learns your habits, values, and patterns
- **Thinks proactively**: Anticipates needs and suggests actions before you ask
- **Tracks everything**: Health, energy, mood, learning, and finances
- **Lives in your Obsidian vault**: Your second brain is BUDDY's memory
- **Coaches you**: Acts as a life coach for habit formation and goal achievement
- **Automates workflows**: Handles repetitive tasks so you can focus on what matters

## Architecture

Built using the `.claude` directory infrastructure inspired by [Daniel Miessler's KAI](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure), BUDDY is designed with:

- **Obsidian-First**: Deep integration with your vault
- **Systems Thinking**: Holistic view across all life domains
- **Continuous Learning**: Every interaction makes BUDDY smarter
- **Collaborative Partnership**: Works with you, not just for you

BUDDY follows these principles:

1. **Obsidian-First Architecture** - Your vault is the source of truth
2. **Deep Personal Understanding** - Quality comes from knowing you
3. **Proactive Intelligence** - Anticipate, don't just react
4. **Continuous Learning** - Compound knowledge over time
5. **Systems Thinking** - Holistic view across life domains
6. **Balanced Autonomy** - Execute independently, confirm major decisions

## Privacy & Data

All personal data stays local on your machine. BUDDY respects your privacy:
- Personal context, memories, and patterns stored locally
- No data sent to third parties
- You control what gets backed up to Git (see `.gitignore`)
